# Recap

Recap is a Command-Line program written in C that recovers "deleted" JPGs from a disk image.

## Description

The program works by iterating through the contents of a memory card, scanning for JPG "signatures"â€“patterns of bytes which demarcate the start of JPGs.
Upon finding a signature, Recap creates a new JPG and begins writing bytes from the memory card to the newly created file until another signature is found.
Thereafter, the program closes the currently open JPG, creates another and then continues the image recovery process.
